    Introduction to Encounters:
-------------------------------------------------------

- Installing Your Theme
Installing Encounters will be just like any other theme by using the 
WordPress theme installer. You can also unzip the theme file and upload
the theme folder with its files into the /wp-content/themes/ folder.

- Theme Options
Encounters comes with the built-in WordPress Theme Customizer which lets
you make personalized changes to your theme layout, colours, and more.
To access the customizer, you can do it from the Dashboard main page
and clicking on the big button "Customize your Site", or from the 
Appearance >> Theme Options.

- Plugins (Optional)
When you look at the Encounters demo website http://demo.styledthemes.com/encounters-lite/
you will find that there are some very nice things sliding, fading, and looking really
nice. These are plugins I am using in the demo, but they are plugins that I
included extra css styling for you, should you decide to install the optional plugins:

(1) Widgetkit (free)
(2) Contact Form 7 (free)
(3) Dynamic Widgets (free)
(4) Widget CSS Classes (free)
(5) Simply Exclude (free)
(6) Advanced Text Widget (free)
(7) Recent Posts Plus (free)
(8) Breadcrumbs NavXT

-------------------------------------------------------
    WARNING: BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------

It's recommended using a "child theme" whenever you want
to make theme modifications to the files. This allows you to make theme updates
whenever they come available without overwriting changes you might have made.
To read more about child themes, please check out the WordPress Codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

- Child Theme Included
I've now included a blank child theme with this theme for you to use
if you decide to make modifications to any files. You can find this in
a folder of your theme files called child-theme where you will find an
installable encounters-lite-child.zip
